## üöÄ RAGGIN Introduction

**RAGGIN** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Guided Intelligence in Next.js) is a powerful **Visual Studio Code extension** designed to assist developers working with the **Next.js framework**. It provides intelligent, real-time support for tasks such as:

- Questions answering
- Code generation, explanation, and suggestions


RAGGIN delivers answers directly inside the editor, so developers can stay focused in their coding environment without needing to switch between browser tabs or external documentation tools.

One of RAGGIN's key features is the ability to ask questions based on a specific version of the Next.js documentation. This ensures that answers are accurate and relevant to the version you're working with, helping avoid deprecated or outdated information.

RAGGIN operates **100% locally**, powered by **Docker** and **Ollama**, eliminating the need for an internet connection during use. However, some resources‚Äîsuch as versioned Next.js documentation and local LLMs‚Äîmust be downloaded beforehand.

By ensuring that all processing happens on your machine, RAGGIN maintains **data privacy** and keeps your development environment secure from external data exposure. It's a smart, privacy-focused solution for modern web developers.
