Question,Expected
"How can I implement a dynamic post editing feature in a Next.js application using the App Router?

The post editing form is a Client Component utilizing useState for local state management.?

The form submits data to a Server Action defined with the ""use server"" directive.?

Upon successful submission, the application revalidates the cache for the updated post and redirects the user to the post's detail page.?

The application provides feedback to the user during the submission process, such as loading indicators and error messages.?

Additionally, how can I ensure that sensitive operations, like updating the post in the database, are securely handled on the server side, and that the client does not have direct access to sensitive information??

Please provide code snippets in TypeScript that demonstrate this functionality.","v15_3_1_react-hydration-error_possible ways to fix it,v15_3_1_07-amp_amp validation,v15_3_1_10-dynamic-routes_convention,v15_3_1_10-dynamic-routes_example,v15_3_1_10-dynamic-routes_typescript"
"How can I implement a responsive image gallery in a Next.js application using the App Router?

Images are stored in the public directory and served as static assets.?

The gallery utilizes the next/image component to optimize images for different device sizes and resolutions.?

The application ensures that images are lazy-loaded and do not cause layout shifts during loading.?

The gallery supports both local images from the public directory and remote images from a trusted external source, with appropriate configuration in next.config.js.?

The application provides a fallback mechanism for images that fail to load.?

Additionally, how can I configure caching headers for the static assets served from the public directory to improve performance, considering that Next.js applies a default Cache-Control: public, max-age=0 header?","v15_3_1_react-hydration-error_possible ways to fix it,v15_3_1_07-amp_amp validation,v15_3_1_04-images-and-fonts_optimizing images,v15_3_1_01-images_image sizing,v15_3_1_image_responsive images"
"You're building a dashboard-style internal tool using the Next.js App Router, where performance is critical. You want to:

Lazy load heavy Client Components (e.g., charts or data visualizations) that arenï¿½t immediately needed on first render.

Ensure type-safety using TypeScript for components and props.

Use dynamic imports with suspense: true and provide a custom loading fallback UI.

Only load third-party libraries like react-chartjs-2 on the client side to reduce bundle size.

How would you set this up properly across your layout, pages, and components? Include code snippets for the following:
1. components/Chart.tsx (Client Component with chart)
```
'use client'

import { Chart as ChartJS, ArcElement, Tooltip, Legend } from 'chart.js';
import { Doughnut } from 'react-chartjs-2';

ChartJS.register(ArcElement, Tooltip, Legend);

type ChartProps = {
  title: string;
  data: number[];
};

export default function Chart({ title, data }: ChartProps) {
  return (
    <div className=""p-4"">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <Doughnut
        data={{
          labels: ['A', 'B', 'C'],
          datasets: [{
            label: title,
            data,
            backgroundColor: ['#F00', '#0F0', '#00F'],
          }]
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

components/ChartLazy.tsx
```
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const Chart = dynamic(() => import('./Chart'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <p>Loading chart...</p>,
  suspense: true,
});

export default Chart;
```

app/dashboard/page.tsx
```
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import Chart from '@/components/ChartLazy';

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <main className=""space-y-8"">
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading Charts...</div>}>
        <Chart title=""User Stats"" data={[10, 20, 30]} />
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}
